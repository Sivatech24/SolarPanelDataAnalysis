# Predictive Maintenance in Solar Power Systems

# Problem Statement: 
Solar power plants play a crucial role in the transition toward clean energy. However, maintaining large solar farms is challenging, as breakdowns or inefficiencies can significantly reduce power output and cause financial losses. Traditionally, maintenance schedules are set based on time intervals, which may lead to over-maintenance or under-maintenance of equipment. The introduction of AI-driven predictive maintenance offers a solution that can help identify potential failures before they happen.
